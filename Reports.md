## 🏗️ System Architecture & Approach

### Architecture Decision Rationale

The system employs a **dual API architecture** designed to separate concerns and optimize performance:

```ascii
SMS Data (XML) → Python Parser → SQLite Database → Dual APIs → Web Dashboard
```

**FastAPI (Port 8000)**: Chosen for high-performance CRUD operations due to:
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Async support for concurrent requests
- Built-in data validation with Pydantic
- Superior performance for real-time operations

**Flask (Port 5000)**: Selected for analytics and reporting because of:
- Mature ecosystem for data processing
- Excellent integration with pandas and openpyxl
- Flexible routing for complex report generation
- Proven reliability for business intelligence tasks

### Database Design Philosophy

**Multiple SQLite Databases**: Strategic decision to use separate databases for different APIs:
- `backend/momo.db` - Primary data storage with optimized schema
- `api/momo_transactions.db` - FastAPI-specific database with compatibility fields
- `backend/transactions.db` - Secondary storage for data redundancy

This approach ensures API independence while maintaining data consistency through synchronized processing.

### Frontend Architecture

**Single Page Application (SPA)** approach using vanilla JavaScript:
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates core web development skills without framework dependencies
- **ECharts Integration**: Professional data visualization with interactive capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Theme System**: Advanced CSS custom properties for dynamic theming

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### SMS Data Processing Pipeline

**Challenge**: Parse unstructured SMS text into structured transaction data  
**Solution**: Multi-layered parsing approach using:

1. **XML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup4 for robust XML handling
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Regex patterns for transaction type identification
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed SMS messages

**Code Architecture**:
```python
# Smart categorization logic
def categorize_transaction(sms_body):
    patterns = {
        'INCOMING_MONEY': [r'received.*RWF', r'sent you.*RWF'],
        'PAYMENT': [r'paid.*RWF.*to', r'payment.*successful'],
        'TRANSFER': [r'transferred.*RWF', r'sent.*RWF.*to'],
        # ... additional patterns
    }
    # Pattern matching and validation logic
```

### Database Schema Evolution

**Initial Challenge**: Column compatibility between APIs  
**Solution**: Adaptive schema with compatibility fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    -- Core fields
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    transaction_id TEXT UNIQUE,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount REAL DEFAULT 0,
    
    -- Compatibility fields for different APIs
    recipient TEXT,          -- Original field
    receiver TEXT,           -- FastAPI compatibility
    raw_message TEXT,        -- Original SMS
    raw_body TEXT,          -- FastAPI compatibility
    
    -- Metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Development Challenges

**Challenge 1**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)  
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive CORS configuration:
```python
# FastAPI CORS setup
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Challenge 2**: Database Column Mismatches  
**Solution**: Dynamic column addition in FastAPI with migration logic:
```python
def ensure_column_exists(cursor, table, column, column_type):
    try:
        cursor.execute(f"ALTER TABLE {table} ADD COLUMN {column} {column_type}")
    except sqlite3.OperationalError:
        pass  # Column already exists
```

**Challenge 3**: Report Generation Performance  
**Solution**: Optimized Excel generation with pandas and openpyxl:
- Streaming data processing for large datasets
- Memory-efficient report generation
- Background processing for complex reports
